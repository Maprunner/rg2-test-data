It's a poor control anyway - thrashing about in masses of holly looking for a bingo control is not my idea of fun.  Mapping also poor to the SE of control 9 - the frontage of those houses extends right to the road.  There is no thin wedge of open orange area, as marked on the map.  Course very average if I'm honest.  Also lots of water features missing from map - big permanent lake near control 12 not mapped and although I messed 4-5 up completely, I passed another large lake and wet area, which was nowhere to be seen on the map - that threw me completely.  Very average map too and in some places quite inaccurate.
