41|429|Helen Errington||My route was somewhat dictated by my lacking a compass. It made me focus on the map & ground and not run off in a general direction
21|50225| GPS Paul Frost||I haven't adjusted the route to match the controls. The difference could be gps error or mapping, there is no easy way to tell.

21|225|Paul Frost||See my gps route for a more detailed plot.#cr##nl#Apart for messing up No.1 (made the mistake of changing my mind mid route, then loosing track of where I was) I am happy with my time. My maximun distance when running/training is about 10k on flat paths, and it takes me an hour. So 26 mins for reading the map, getting lost, and the more physical terrain is good for me!
17|133|Simon Errington||Too busy planning ahead on teh way to 1 to look where I was going, hence the non-optimum route. Somehow missed the vital path junction on the way to 19 which was a bit annoying given the rest of the race had been OK. Fastes corrected minutes per kilometre I have ever managed at Ashridge, but then it is still getting faster and faster as the brambles disappear.

51|501|Alison Sloman||Type your comment Slow 3 t0 4 Off line due to bramble near 3. Too low at 6, got to knoll. Mistook first path for second one due to lack of concentration. Lucky there was a control on the knoll so realised where I was
