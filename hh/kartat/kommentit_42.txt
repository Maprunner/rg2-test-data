Brain wasn't working when leaving 16 so went wrong way - although didn't spot I could have gone on path through OOB area

3|50077| GPS  Buxton Ian||.. of course when I put 'vegitation' on my previous upload of course I meant 'vegetation' - no obvious way to go back and correct typos!
4|199| Marshall Bruce||8 Plan was to use the veg boundary to the South, but I failed to follow it, and then drifted NW where there was lots of unmapped holly.#cr##nl#12 I must have passed within 5 metres of the flag.  I suspect the map is wrong around here.#cr##nl##cr##nl#see my GPS track

4|50199| GPS  Marshall Bruce||A few O-comments in my drawn route.#cr##nl##cr##nl#This was my first time using GPS tracking.#cr##nl#I know from driving and walking around after the event that my GPS was sometimes out by 50metres.  This was confirmed by the difficulty in getting the gps track to fit the O-map in several places.
4|137| Prowting Jim||Lost 15 sec at 1 extricating compass cord from kite string.#cr##nl#Not a misclick - did go through building 4-5!
3|50051| GPS  Thetford Roger||Nice to start somewhere different.#cr##nl#Annoyed to follow wrong feature not once but twice (veg boundary at 5, path at 9). Then hestitant to 10, tangled with fallen timber 11-12, missed knoll approaching 17 so uncertain again. Otherwise OK. Glad that we had a reasonable stretch out of the holly, in the fast-running northern part.
