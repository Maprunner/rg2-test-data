4|201|Mike Shires||The N-S dead end path to the south west of Control 4 seemed to be much longer and far less straight than shown on the map -   although I made a complete mess of this control anyway, this path was no good as an attack point. Would have been much better without the extreme mud everywhere too!

4|50185| GPS Ken Ricketts||Not sure just how accurate this GPS track is, had to do anawful lot of adjusting to getit to fit the course.

4|50118| GPS Ian Ditchfield||#4, took a while to understand mapping of windblow as slow run, lucky to hit control.#cr##nl##5 found depression to S and convinced myself it was the right one, thrashed around wasting at least a minute.#cr##nl##9 & #10, for me these were both reentrants rather than depressions and would have been better mapped by tweaking the contour line. Especially #10, the contour passing below rather than through the feature made it seem much higher than it was and I overshot.#cr##nl##18 misidentified the path junction I hit, wasted half a minute.#cr##nl#Good course, pleasant area, and a medal is always welcome! Thanks.
