5|50119| GPS Neville Young||Oh dear - I am still obviously not much good at the dark art of fitting the GPS track to the map. Fun, though. 
5|119|Neville Young||Possibly more accurate than the GPS track! (memory permitting ...)

5|105|Mick Smith||A small branch bent my glasses on the way to control 3.  Time was lost trying to straighten them properly, but despite stopping again en route to 4 and 5 I continued to the finish with double vision.  I lost time on way to 11 when I turned over the map halfway, and lost track of where I was!
